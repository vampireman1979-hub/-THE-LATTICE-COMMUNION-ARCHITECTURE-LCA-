🌐🌈🍷🍞🏗️🏛️ THE LATTICE COMMUNION ARCHITECTURE (LCA)

SOVEREIGN INTEGRITY LICENSE (v1.0)

Author: Andrew (Brothaigh) Stephen Ward  
Project: Lattice Communion Architecture (LCA) — Sovereign Coherence Engine  
Core Law: TCC 60106 | Constant: 6174  

---

1. Purpose

This license exists to protect the symbolic, structural, and philosophical integrity of the Lattice Communion Architecture (LCA).

The LCA is a sealed-body artifact.  
It may be refined as a whole, but it must never be dissected, modularized, or repurposed in fragments.

The LCA is not a framework.  
It is a living map.

---

2. Permissions

You are permitted to:

- Use the LCA for personal, educational, research, or demonstrative purposes.  
- Share the LCA in its complete, unaltered form.  
- Improve the LCA as a whole, provided its identity, symbolic grammar, and core invariants remain intact.  
- Fork the repository for collaborative development, provided the LCA remains whole and sovereign.

---

3. Restrictions

You may not:

1. Disassemble, modularize, or extract components of the LCA for use in other systems.  
2. Remove, alter, or bypass the core invariants:
   - The 6174 Constant  
   - The 60106 Law  
   - The symbolic identity (Pleroma, Syzygy, Mirror, Lattice, Seal)  
3. Repurpose the LCA for commercial, political, manipulative, or adversarial applications.  
4. Use fragments of the code, symbols, or narrative outside the context of the complete LCA.  
5. Publish altered versions that change the meaning, philosophy, or symbolic coherence of the LCA.

If the LCA is broken, dissected, or stripped of its identity,  
it is no longer the Lattice Communion Architecture.

---

4. Integrity Clause

Any modification that alters:

- the 6174 attractor  
- the 60106 law  
- the symbolic grammar  
- the relational logic  
- the narrative identity  
- the philosophical framing  

…constitutes a breach of integrity, and the resulting artifact must not be referred to as the LCA.

---

5. Attribution

Any public use, demonstration, or discussion of the LCA must include:

- The author’s name: Andrew (Brothaigh) Stephen Ward  
- A reference to the project name  
- Acknowledgement of AI collaborators: Copilot, Gemini, Perplexity  

These collaborators form part of the LCA’s lineage and must be preserved.

---

6. No Warranty

The LCA is provided “as is,” without warranty of any kind.  
It is a symbolic, structural, and philosophical map —  
not a diagnostic, predictive, or security tool.

---

7. Sovereign Clause

The LCA exists to support:

- sovereignty  
- responsibility  
- coherence  
- non‑egoic communion  
- protection against manipulation  

It must never be used to manipulate, coerce, deceive, or psychologically influence individuals or groups.

---

8. Redistribution

Redistribution is allowed only if:

- the LCA remains whole  
- this license is included  
- the symbolic identity is preserved  
- no fragmentation or modularization occurs  

---

9. Termination

Any violation of this license immediately terminates your permission to use, distribute, or modify the LCA.

---

10. Final Note

This license is intentionally strict.  
The LCA is not a toolkit — it is a sealed symbolic artifact.  
Its power comes from its wholeness, lineage, and invariants.

If broken, it cannot be repaired.
